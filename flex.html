    <p>A supercar – also called exotic car – is a loosely defined description of street-legal, high-performance luxury sports car. Since the 2000s or 2010s, the term hypercar has come into use for the highest performing supercars. Supercars commonly serve as the flagship model within a vehicle manufacturer's lineup of sports cars.In the United States, muscle cars were often referred to as "supercars" during the 1960s.</p>
    <p>During the 1960s, cars that are now considered to be muscle cars were then referred to as supercars.[9][10](p8) The term was sometimes spelled with a capital S.[11] In 1966 the sixties supercar became an official industry trend.[9](p8) For example, the May 1965 issue of the American magazine Car Life includes multiple references to supercars and "the supercar club"[12] and a 1968 issue of Car & Driver magazine refers to "the Supercar street racer gang" market segment.[13] In the model name of the AMC S/C Rambler, the "S/C" is an abbreviation for "SuperCar".Since the decline of the muscle car in the 1970s, the word supercar came to mean a car in the mold of a Lamborghini or Ferrari. Other interpretations of the term are for limited-production models produced by small manufacturers for enthusiasts, and, less so, standard-looking cars modified for increased performance.</p>

    <h2>Hypercar</h2>
    <p>A more recent term for high-performance sportscars is "hypercar", which is sometimes used to describe the highest performing supercars. As per supercars, there is no set definition for what constitutes a hypercar. An attempt to define these is "a limited-production, top-of-the-line supercar with a price of around or more than US$1 million.Some people consider the 1993 McLaren F1 to be the first hypercar, while others believe the 2005 Bugatti Veyron was the first hypercar.With a recent shift towards electrification, many recent hypercars use a hybrid drivetrain, a trend started in 2013 by the McLaren P1, Porsche 918 Spyder, and LaFerrari in 2016 Koenigsegg Regera, in 2017 Mercedes-AMG One, in 2019 Ferrari SF90 Stradale.Modern hypercars such as Pininfarina Battista, NIO EP9, Rimac C Two, and Lotus Evija have also gone full-electric.Hypercars will also be able to be used as a base for Le Mans Prototype cars when rule changes come into effect from 2021.</p>
